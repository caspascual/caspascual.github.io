In the Fall of 2020, my physics teacher gave us 2 options for our final project: a movie trailer or a musical. My team decided to go with a movie trailer. Part of the assignment was to incorporate physics concepts in the trailer that we can explain and calculate to our professor. During our brainstorm process, we couldn't think of any movie that had the required number of physics concepts needed for that A+ so we decided to come up with our own movie.

The physics concepts that we decided to show in our movie were: velocity, acceleration, newton's first, second, and third law, projectile velocity, kinetic energy, centripetal acceleration, torque, and harmonic series. ~write more later~
