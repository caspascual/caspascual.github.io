## The Start
I remember when I was gifted the original iPad at a young age. I always played Plants vs. Zombies and thought how cool it and all the other apps installed on the iPad were. It’s what first got me interested in technology. As I grew older, that interest only grew stronger and I thought to myself, “How exactly do these apps work? How can I make my own apps?”. As I was still very ignorant about things back then, it was only until my 6th-grade computer class that I found out about software engineering.

## CS
Computer Science is tremendously broad and increasingly important science. Some concepts within CS are algorithms, AI and machine learning, networking, data analysis, etc. Now more than ever, numerous different fields are requiring a basic understanding of programming. Right now, I myself am pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. With it, I plan to join the workforce as a software engineer.

## What I Can Do
With my current skills right now, however, no employer would even consider hiring me. I currently lack knowledge on some of the more specific CS topics and I don’t even have any work or intern experience. With the remaining semesters I have at UH Manoa, I wish to hone my skills in back-end software engineering. Back-end software engineers are expected to make very efficient code, maintain websites, and manipulate databases. There are numerous courses at Manoa that’ll help me learn those skills.

Aside from the things I can learn from professors and textbooks, I hope to have more experience. Software engineers will generally work as a team. Using ACManoa and internships as a medium, I want to experience what it’s like to work in a team and hopefully gain good teamsmanship so that no matter if we have good or bad chemistry, we can still get things done.

## From Here On
It’s going to be a long and hard journey but anything CS-related has always been a topic that’s had my full attention and interest. Even further in the future, I hope that I can gain the skills to be an all-rounder. For now, however, I’m doing what I can to reach the first climax in my life goals.
