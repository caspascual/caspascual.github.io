## A New Ride
Out of all the weeks in a college semester, one of the most important is definitely the first week. It’s the only time you can take to familiarize yourself with your new classes and switch them if necessary. My start into my ICS 314 class, which is Introduction to Software Engineering, was like a rollercoaster that started off extraordinarily fast.

## Learning a New Language
In our first week, we had to learn all the basics of Javascript. Now I know what you’re thinking, _“Javascript is not that hard of a language”_, and you’re absolutely right. A lot of the material we were given was very similar to what I have learned and experienced in the past in other languages. They have the same pattern but different syntax. Part of the lesson also had ES6 included which was not something that I have experience in. I found the new syntax and features of ES6 to be very useful and make code easier and cleaner. From a software engineering perspective, Javascript is definitely a good starter language along with Python as they’re both relatively easy to use. Even as one further’s their software development career, I think the language is suitable for many front-end developers.

## New Year, New Me
Everyone knows this classic saying. It’s usually accompanied by a New Year’s resolution to stay healthy or go to the gym and work out. However in this class, instead of working on our bodies, we’re working on our minds with a workout of the day, or WOD for short. It’s part of a pedagogy called [“Athletic Software Engineering”](https://philipmjohnson.org/essays/athletic-software-engineering.html) developed by Philip Johnson, a professor at my own college, the University of Hawaii at Manoa. For our WOD, we’re given a coding task that we have to complete within a specified time range. When first starting out, it was very stressful for me, and at times, I couldn’t even finish within the given time. However, it was very fun and the WODs showed me the many ignorant mistakes I need to work on. For me, it’s an efficient way to learn as it takes time and repetition for me to start remembering and making habits. If there’s one new year’s resolution that I must keep, it’s definitely the coding workout of the day.

## Final Thoughts
In hindsight, my first week of class wasn’t that bad. If I were to explain further about my rollercoaster, the stress I felt originally at the start was like the initial shock at the start; you know it’s gonna happen but you still can’t help yourself from reacting to it. Like rollercoasters, I feel that the class will become more enjoyable as it goes on.
